// Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. 
// Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted 
// membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First 
// node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of 
// club. Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly 
// linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:  
// a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.  
// b) Compute total number of members of club 
// c) Display members  
// d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists
